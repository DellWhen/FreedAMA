## How to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository**

2. **Set up a virtual environment**:
    If you donâ€™t have `virtualenv` installed, you can install it using:
    ```bash
    pip install virtualenv
    ```
    Then create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    virtualenv venv
    ```
    Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
      ```bash
      venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - On Mac/Linux:
      ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run db.py to set up the database**:
    - Create a MySQL database for the project.
    - Update the `settings.py` file with your MySQL database credentials.

5. **Run migrations**:
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

6. **Create a superuser** (for admin access):
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

7. **Run the development server**:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
    Now, you can access the application by opening a web browser and going to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
